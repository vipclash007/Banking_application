## 🏗️ Architecture

This is a **client-server** application with the following components:

- **Client**: GUI or CLI to request banking operations (e.g., view balance, deposit, withdraw).
- **Server**: Hosts the RMI registry, exposes remote methods, and handles business logic.
- **Database Layer**: Uses Hibernate to manage account data in the backend database.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Java RMI**
- **Hibernate ORM**
- **MySQL** (or any compatible RDBMS)
- **JDK 8+**
- **Maven/Gradle** (for dependency management)
